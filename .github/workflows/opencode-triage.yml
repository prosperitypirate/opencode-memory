            Triage this GitHub issue for the opencode-memory project — a self-hosted
            AI coding assistant memory system (LanceDB + Voyage AI embeddings,
            TypeScript plugin, Python/FastAPI backend, React frontend).

            Steps:
            1. Read the issue title and body carefully.
            2. Classify it as one of: bug, feature-request, question, docs, performance,
               security, or invalid/duplicate.
            3. Post a single helpful comment that:
               - Acknowledges the issue in 1-2 sentences
               - Adds a relevant label (use: bug, enhancement, question, documentation,
                 performance, security, invalid, duplicate)
               - If it's a bug: ask for reproduction steps if missing, and point to the
                 relevant component (plugin/, backend/, frontend/, or memory server)
               - If it's a feature request: briefly assess feasibility given the
                 architecture (self-hosted LanceDB, Voyage AI embeddings, OpenCode plugin SDK)
               - If it's a question: answer it directly if you can from the codebase,
                 otherwise point to the relevant file
               - If invalid/spam/duplicate: politely close with a brief explanation
            4. Do not over-explain. Keep the comment concise and useful.
