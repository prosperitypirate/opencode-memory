# What is codexfi?

codexfi is a plugin for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) that gives your AI coding agent **persistent memory across sessions**. Architecture decisions, tech stack context, progress tracking, error solutions, user preferences — everything is automatically extracted from conversations, stored locally, and retrieved automatically — injected into the system prompt before every LLM call, with semantically relevant memories refreshed on every turn.

The agent simply *remembers*.

<DocsMemoryCycle />

## How it works

After every assistant turn, codexfi analyzes the conversation and extracts key facts as typed memories. Each memory is embedded with [Voyage AI](https://www.voyageai.com/) (`voyage-code-3`) and stored in an embedded [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/) database on your machine.

Before every LLM call, a `[MEMORY]` block is injected into the system prompt containing:

- **Project Brief** — what the project is and its goals
- **Architecture** — system design and component relationships
- **Tech Context** — stack, tools, build commands
- **Product Context** — why the project exists, problems solved
- **Progress & Status** — current state of work
- **Last Session** — summary of the previous conversation
- **User Preferences** — cross-project personal preferences
- **Relevant to Current Task** — the only section updated on every single turn

<RelevantToTaskCallout />

This block is rebuilt on every LLM call.

## Key features

<DocsKeyFeatures />

## Quick start

```bash
bunx codexfi install
```

This registers the plugin with OpenCode, prompts for API keys, and creates the `/memory-init` slash command. Restart OpenCode, and the agent starts remembering.

See the [Installation guide](/docs/installation) for detailed setup instructions.

## Requirements

- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) — the AI coding agent
- [Voyage AI API key](https://dash.voyageai.com/api-keys) — for embedding generation (required)
- One extraction provider API key — [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/) (default), [xAI](https://console.x.ai/), or [Google AI](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) (required)
