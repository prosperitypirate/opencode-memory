# What is codexfi?

codexfi is a plugin for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) that gives your AI coding agent **persistent memory across sessions**. Architecture decisions, tech stack context, progress tracking, error solutions, user preferences — everything is automatically extracted from conversations, stored locally, and retrieved at the start of every new session.

The agent simply *remembers*.

## How it works

After every assistant turn, codexfi analyzes the conversation and extracts key facts as typed memories. Each memory is embedded with [Voyage AI](https://www.voyageai.com/) (`voyage-code-3`) and stored in an embedded [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/) database on your machine.

At the start of every session, a `[MEMORY]` block is injected into the system prompt containing:

- **Project Brief** — what the project is and its goals
- **Architecture** — system design and component relationships
- **Tech Context** — stack, tools, build commands
- **Product Context** — why the project exists, problems solved
- **Progress & Status** — current state of work
- **Last Session** — summary of the previous conversation
- **User Preferences** — cross-project personal preferences
- **Relevant to Current Task** — semantically matched memories for the current topic

This block is rebuilt on every LLM call. As the conversation shifts topics, different memories surface automatically.

## Key features

- **Fully automatic** — memories save after every assistant turn with zero user action
- **Self-hosted** — all data stays on your machine; no cloud, no Docker, no separate server
- **Code-optimized embeddings** — Voyage `voyage-code-3` (1024 dimensions), purpose-built for code
- **Multi-provider extraction** — Anthropic Claude Haiku (default), xAI Grok (fastest), Google Gemini (native JSON)
- **Typed memory system** — 11 memory types for structured knowledge organization
- **Smart deduplication** — cosine similarity prevents storing duplicate memories
- **Relational versioning** — contradicting memories are automatically superseded
- **Compaction-proof** — memory lives in the system prompt, surviving context window truncation
- **Privacy filter** — wrap content in `<private>...</private>` to exclude it from extraction

## Quick start

```bash
bunx codexfi install
```

This registers the plugin with OpenCode, prompts for API keys, and creates the `/memory-init` slash command. Restart OpenCode, and the agent starts remembering.

See the [Installation guide](/docs/installation) for detailed setup instructions.

## Requirements

- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) — the AI coding agent
- [Voyage AI API key](https://dash.voyageai.com/api-keys) — for embedding generation (required)
- One extraction provider API key — [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/) (default), [xAI](https://console.x.ai/), or [Google AI](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) (required)
